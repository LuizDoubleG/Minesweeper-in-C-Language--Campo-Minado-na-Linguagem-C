# Minesweeper in C Language (Campo Minado na Linguagem C) 
  This is a repository that contains a minesweeper game entirely made by me using C language, aiming to be executed in a 
terminal, without graphical interface.

  This game adaptation was just a summer project, I hope that the tricks I used in the code can be of some use and learning to you, and the game itself may be fun for someone who enjoys these unusual adaptations.
