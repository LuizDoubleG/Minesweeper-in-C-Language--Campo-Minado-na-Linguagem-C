# Minesweeper in C Language (Campo Minado na Linguagem C) 
  This is a repository to contain the minesweeper game made by me entirely in C language to be executed in a 
terminal, without graphical interface.
  This game adaptation was just a summer project, I hope that the tricks I made in the code can be of some use and learning for someone, and that the game itself may be fun for someone who enjoys these unusual inventions
